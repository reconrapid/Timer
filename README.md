# WPF Countdown Timer
A basic countdown timer application for Windows. Created using the TimeSpan & Systems.Timer libraries. Simply enter the hours, minutes & seconds you wish the timer to start at & then press "start". The timer will then begin counting down every second until this reaches zero or until you press the "stop" button.
